			<b>Installation</b><br/>
			<br/>
			The installion is just easy. Extract the wpdojoloader.zip under the wordpress/wp-content/plugins
			directory so that you have a subfolder which is called wpdojoloader.<br/>
			(A small hint: wpdojoloader does not require to overwrite any other wordpress files,
			exempt from a previous wpdojoloader installation.<br/>
			So if you're beeing asked... There's probably something wrong ! )<br/>

		<span mark="configuration">
			<b>Configuration</b><br/>
			<br/>
			With a normal wordpress configuration you should not have to configure anything.
			But if you are using a wordpress multi installation you probably have to configure
			the path to the wordpress content directory if you are using a datagrid.
			In the wpdojoloader.php you find a section called "Beging Config Section" there you can
			change some settings.
		</span>
		
		<span mark="activate">
			<b>Activate the plugin</b><br/>
			<br/>
			Just go to settings -> wpdojoloader<br/>
			Check if "Activate Dojo Loader Plugin?" is "yes" scroll down and click update settings...
			<br/><br/>
			That's it: <br/>
